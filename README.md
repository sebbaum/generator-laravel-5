# generator-laravel-5 [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> Installs Laravel-5 and enables BrowserSync

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-laravel-5 using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-laravel-5
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo laravel-5
```

## Proxy
You can choose from where your application is served:
* php artisan serve (localhost:8000)
* localhost (Use this, if you serve your application via a webserver (local or remote))
The proxy configuration is required for BrowserSync and can be changed in `webpack.mix.js`

## Integrated packages
The following packages are integrated in the new Laravel project by default:
* doctrine/dbal
* barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper
* barryvdh/laravel-debugbar
* barryvdh/laravel-cors
* phpmetrics/phpmetrics
* beyondcode/laravel-self-diagnosis

## Code analyzes
In order to perform a code analyzes with phpmetrics you can run:
```
composer run-script analyze
```
This will create a folder named `phpmetrics` and you can get interesting insights by opening
`phpmetrics/index.html`

## Frontend development with browserSync
If you serve your application with `php artisan serve` (http://localhost:8000) you have to start
this first before you can start watching your files with browserSync.

In order to have webpack watch your file changes and reload your browser, run `npm run watch`.
You have to open your browser an navigate to `http:localhost:3000`

## Git versioning
If you want to, you can initialize a local git repository to version your code.
This is turned on by default. After scaffolding your new laravel application there is an initial
commit in your local repository.
